[Heavybit's](http://heavybit.com) Code of Conduct
=======

## We Value a Culture of Inclusion
We unequivocally and without prejudice want to surround ourselves with as many talented people as we can. Software is the future and in order for it to be a good one, it should include individuals with a diverse set of values, skills, knowledge, experiences and histories. As such, we are committed to providing an encouraging, safe and welcoming environment, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, or religion.

## We Foster Participation
We believe in encouraging participation from traditionally marginalized groups. We believe those traditionally left out of industry-shaping conversations should help design today’s developer ecosystem. We advocate for a diverse group of experts, founders and employees through Heavybit’s pipeline efforts, events, leadership circles, speakers bureaus and mentorship pool. We urge our event and community partners to do the same.

## Conferences
Heavybit has a specific set of guidelines for our larger conferences, please read our conference conduct policy [here](./conference-conduct.md).

## We have a Zero Tolerance Policy
We want to surround ourselves with as many diverse voices as we can, and as a result, aim to provide a professional and respectful space for participation. To that end, we have zero-tolerance for behavior that is counter to these values including sexualized, demeaning, or insensitive content or inappropriate comments regarding age, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability and appearance, race, religion, technology choices or any other factor. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind, regardless of whether comments or actions deemed inappropriate are intentional or unintentional.

* **The community models behavior**. If someone in your company or immediate community is making you or others uncomfortable, you are responsible for addressing it promptly in a direct, respectful and adult manner. This will ensure the behavior does not continue and negatively affect others in the community. If mediation is required, speak with someone within your organization (such as an HR representative) on de-escalation and effective comms techniques before moving on to Heavybit. 
* **Heavybit has an official conduct process**. If this behavior continues, please raise a formal complaint and email [conduct@heavybit.com](mailto:conduct@heavybit.com). This email alias goes to Heavybit’s Conduct Committee. Your complaint will be kept confidential within Heavybit’s Conduct Committee, however we may reach out to other community members for context if deemed necessary. If this happens at an event, please speak to a member of Heavybit staff.
* **Bad behavior will be addressed**. Bad behavior will be addressed. For cases in which Heavybit is involved, we will act swiftly to address the accusations and will take any actions we deem appropriate to correct the situation including in extreme cases, banning individuals from our clubhouse, events or online communities.

If you have suggestions for changes to this policy, feel free to write a [pull request](https://github.com/heavybit/conduct) or email [conduct@heavybit.com](mailto:conduct@heavybit.com).
