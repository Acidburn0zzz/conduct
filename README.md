[Heavybit's](http://heavybit.com) Statement of Inclusion
=======

##We Value a Culture of Inclusion and Participation
We unequivocally and without prejudice want to surround ourselves with as many talented people as we can. Software is the future and in order for it to be a good one, it should include individuals with a diverse set of values, skills, knowledge, experiences and histories. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, or religion.

##We Foster Participation
We believe in encouraging participation from traditionally marginalized groups. We believe those traditionally left out of industry-shaping conversations should help design today’s developer ecosystem.  We advocate for a diverse group of experts through Heavybit’s leadership circles, speakers bureaus and mentorship pool.  We urge our event and community partners to do the same.

##Conferences
Heavybit has a specific set of guidelines for our larger conferences, please read our conference conduct policy [here](./conference-conduct.md).

##We have a Zero Tolerance Policy
We want to surround ourselves with people who share [this set of values](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) and provide a [safe-space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space). To that end, we have zero-tolerance for behavior that is counter to these values including sexualized, demeaning, or insensitive content or inappropriate comments regarding age, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability, physical appearance, race, religion, or any other factor. Whether intentional or unintentional, we do not tolerate harassment of any kind.

* **The community models behavior**.  If someone is making you or others uncomfortable, don’t let it slide.  We encourage you to address inappropriate behavior in a direct, respectful and adult manner. Those asked to stop their inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.
* **Heavybit has an official conduct process**. If this behavior continues, please raise a formal complaint and email [conduct@heavybit.com](mailto:conduct@heavybit.com). This email alias goes to Heavybit’s Conduct Committee. If this happens at an event, please speak to a member of Heavybit staff identified by their staff badge.
* **Bad behavior will be addressed**. In cases where Heavybit is involved, we will act swiftly to investigate the accusations and will take any actions we deem appropriate to correct the situation including in extreme cases, banning individuals from our clubhouse, events or online communities

If you have suggestions for changes to this policy, feel free to write a [pull request](https://github.com/heavybit/conduct) or email [conduct@heavybit.com](mailto:conduct@heavybit.com).
